It's great to hear you're a fan of Indonesian horror! It's a fantastic genre with a unique blend of folklore, jump scares, and often deeply unsettling psychological elements. Since you've watched many, I'll try to give you some recommendations that might offer something new or are highly acclaimed.
Here are a few good Indonesian horror movies I'd recommend, trying to cover a range of styles and release dates:
Modern Classics & Must-Watches (if you haven't seen them):
 * Satan's Slaves (Pengabdi Setan) (2017) and Satan's Slaves 2: Communion (2022): Directed by Joko Anwar, these are arguably the films that kickstarted the recent Indonesian horror boom. They are incredibly atmospheric, genuinely terrifying, and beautifully shot, drawing heavily on classic Indonesian folklore and the original 1980 film.
 * Impetigore (Perempuan Tanah Jahanam) (2019): Another masterpiece from Joko Anwar. This folk horror film is deeply unsettling, visually stunning, and tells a chilling story rooted in traditional beliefs and curses. It's less about jump scares and more about building a pervasive sense of dread.
 * May the Devil Take You (Sebelum Iblis Menjemput) (2018) and May the Devil Take You Too (2020): Directed by Timo Tjahjanto, these films are more visceral and gory, often compared to "The Evil Dead." They are high-energy, brutal, and packed with demonic possession and practical effects.
 * The Queen of Black Magic (Ratu Ilmu Hitam) (2019): A remake of the 1979 classic, written by Joko Anwar and directed by Kimo Stamboel. This one is a brutal and shocking tale of revenge and black magic, featuring some truly disturbing imagery.
 * KKN di Desa Penari (2022) / Dancing Village: The Curse Begins (2024 - prequel): Based on a viral true story, this film taps into deep-seated fears about stepping into forbidden spiritual territory. It was a massive box office hit in Indonesia and has a strong focus on traditional Javanese elements and the mythical Badarawuhi.
Recent and Noteworthy:
 * Sewu Dino (2023): Another film based on a viral story, "Sewu Dino" (meaning "A Thousand Days") is a ritualistic horror film that has garnered a lot of attention. It involves a girl afflicted by a powerful black magic curse and the lengths a family goes to break it.
 * Grave Torture (Siksa Kubur) (2024): Directed by Joko Anwar, this is his latest offering and has been highly anticipated. It explores the concept of grave punishment in Islamic belief, focusing on a woman seeking proof of her parents' sins in their graves.
 * Sijjin (2023): This film is an Indonesian adaptation of a popular Turkish horror series, and it leans heavily into Islamic black magic and jinn possession. It's known for its intense and disturbing sequences.
 * Qodrat (2022): A horror film that combines elements of exorcism and spiritual warfare, set in an Islamic boarding school. It's quite intense and visually striking.
 * Ivanna (2022): A spin-off from the "Danur" universe (which you might have seen), this film focuses on the vengeful ghost of a Dutch woman during the Japanese occupation. It's known for its unsettling atmosphere and jump scares.
A Bit Older, but Worth Checking Out:
 * Macabre (Rumah Dara) (2009): From The Mo Brothers (Timo Tjahjanto and Kimo Stamboel), this is a truly gruesome and relentless slasher/gore film. If you like extreme horror, this is a must-see.
 * The Forbidden Door (Pintu Terlarang) (2009): A psychological thriller with horror elements, also by Joko Anwar. It's a dark and disturbing film that delves into obsession and hidden desires.
Tips for finding them:
 * Shudder: Many of the best modern Indonesian horror films, especially those from Joko Anwar and Timo Tjahjanto, are available on Shudder.
 * Netflix: Netflix often has a rotating selection of Indonesian horror, including some of the "Danur" series films and "Suzzanna: Buried Alive."
 * YouTube: You might find some older or independent films on YouTube, though quality and legal streaming can vary.
Enjoy your continued journey into the chilling world of Indonesian horror! Let me know if you're looking for something specific (e.g., more folk horror, slasher, psychological).
